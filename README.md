# Abstract
This project focuses on the problematic presented by the British company Nationwide Hire, client of DCSL Software Ltd, current employer of the author of this project.

Nationwide Hire is an intermediary between customers and suppliers, like a trading-hub or a broker. They make a formal contract with the client, who asks for some equipment to rent. They source it, ordering it from a supplier. Then they get it delivered to the customer and get it collected at the end of the rent period. The terms in the contract are frequently modified by the client, which arises many disputes between Nationwide Hire and their clients, as some clients claim the changes on the terms of the contract never happened.

Then, there is the need for a system which stores the contract, along with all its modifications, in a blockchain that acts as a reliable and immutable repository and guarantees the integrity of all its data. In the United Kingdom, Blockchain technology is acceptable evidence to resolve legal disputes.
